# Blockchain-Based Vehicle Reputation System

> A system to mitigate false data injection in connected vehicles by using a blockchain-based vehicle reputation framework.

## Project Overview

Connected and autonomous vehicles rely on sharing traffic information in real time. However, malicious or faulty vehicles can send false reports (e.g., fake accidents, false traffic jams), leading to **inefficient routing, safety risks, and traffic disruption**.  

This project implements a **Digital Trust Book** using blockchain to manage vehicle reputation:

- Honest cars gain **reputation points**.
- Dishonest cars lose points.
- Immutable blockchain ensures the reputation history cannot be tampered with.
- Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus allows **fast, energy-efficient, and secure updates** via trusted Road Side Units (RSUs).
